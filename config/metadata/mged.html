<p>Warning: The MGED Ontology is deprecated and its concepts
	subsumed into the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI). Users
	are encouraged to migrate to OBI for updated content. MGED Ontology
	contains concepts, definitions, terms, and resources for standardized
	description of a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1. The MGED
	ontology is divided into the MGED Core ontology, intended to be stable
	and in synch with MAGE v.1, and the MGED Extended ontology, which adds
	further associations and classes not found in MAGE v.1.</p>
