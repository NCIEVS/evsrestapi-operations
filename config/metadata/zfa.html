<p>Zebrafish Model Organism Database (Zebrafish) is an ontology of
	zebrafish anatomical terms, including many definitions and synonyms.
	The ontology provides standard terminology for annotating gene
	expression and phenotypes, thus providing a link between these two
	types of data commonly used to study gene function. It is produced by
	the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN).</p>
