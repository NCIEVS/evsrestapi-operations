<p>Medication Reference Terminology (MED-RT™) is the successor to the Veterans Health Administration National Drug File
    – Reference Terminology (VHA NDF-RT™). Both terminologies are formal ontological representations of medication
    terminology, pharmacologic classifications, and asserted relationships between them.
<p>MED-RT™ is a concept-oriented terminology– a collection of concepts, each of which has a single meaning. Every
    concept has one fully-specified and/or preferred name, and a varying number of synonyms. Concepts in external
    terminologies referenced in MED-RT™ have a native unique identifier, considered here as their “Code in Source”.
    Additionally, MED-RT™ assigns an alphanumeric unique identifier (NUI) to every concept it owns, published to label
    and track that meaning across releases.
<p>MED-RT™ provides a formal content model that describes medication active ingredients, both computationally and to
    humans, by naming or identifying relevant concepts and describing them via named relations to other concepts, either
    within MED-RT™ or in external terminologies.
<p>Representation of MED-RT™ in the NCI Term Browser is based on the single-source extraction from the NCI
    Metathesaurus. It contains MED-RT™ synonyms, MED-RT™ to MED-RT™ relationships, and a MED-RT™ hierarchy. For a
    complete view of MED-RT™, including external relationships and terms referencing to MeSH, SNOMED-CT US Edition, and
    RxNorm, please visit the <a href="https://ncim.nci.nih.gov">NCI Metathesaurus Browser</a>.
