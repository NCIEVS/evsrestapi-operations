<p>The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
	Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is based on the World Health
	Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
	(ICD-10). ICD-10-CM will be used to code and classify morbidity data
	from inpatient and outpatient records, physician offices, and most
	National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) surveys. ICD-10-CM is
	scheduled to be the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and
	procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.</p>

<p>ICD-10-CM provides coded hierarchical classifications for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>diseases and injuries;</li>
	<li>surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures;
	<li>supplementary classification of external causes of injury and
		poisoning; and
	<li>supplementary classification of factors influencing health
		status and contact with health services.
</ul>

<p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers
	for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are the U.S. governmental
	agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to
	ICD-10-CM.</p>
