  RadLex is an active, curated reference ontology for radiology. It has been 
  developed under the sponsorship of the Radiological Society of North America 
  (RSNA) with additional support from the National Institute of Biomedical 
  Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the National Cancer Institute's cancer 
  Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). Development work has been done by volunteer 
  Subspecialty Lexicon Development Committees composed of representatives from 
  numerous organizations across the radiologic and general physician community.
