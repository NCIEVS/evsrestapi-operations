<p>NCI Metathesaurus (NCIm) is a wide-ranging biomedical terminology
	database that covers most terminologies used by NCI for clinical care,

<div class="welcome-title-small">NCIm features:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Maps 7,000,000 terms from more than 100 sources into 2,700,000
		biomedical concepts that represent their meaning.</li>
	<li>Displays preferred terms, synonyms, definitions, and other
		information from each source.</li>
	<li>More than 20,000,000 cross-links between content elements.</li>

	NCIm contains most public domain terminologies from the National
	Library of Medicine's UMLS Metathesaurus, as well as many other
	biomedical terminologies created by or of interest to NCI and its
	partners. Some proprietary terminologies are included, with permission,
