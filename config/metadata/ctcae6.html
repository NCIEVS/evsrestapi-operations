<p>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is widely accepted throughout the oncology community as the
    standard classification and severity grading scale for adverse events in cancer therapy clinical trials and other
    oncology settings. Version 6 was published by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) in July 2025. It
    is organized by MedDRA System Organ Class and mapped to MedDRA LLTs with corresponding MedDRA codes, and harmonized
    with MedDRA at the Adverse Event (AE) level including revised AE terms and severity indicators to reflect clinical
    effects identified with current oncology interventions.Severity grades are assigned and most are defined to clarify
    the meaning of the term. CTCAE is designed to integrate into information networks for safety data exchange, and is
    the primary standard for data management for AE data collection, analysis, and patient outcomes associated with
    cancer research and care.</p>
