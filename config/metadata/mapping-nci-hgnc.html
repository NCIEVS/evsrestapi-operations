This is a manual EVS mapping of concepts with equivalent meaning in the source and target terminology versions shown
below:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: NCIt (NCI Thesaurus) 24.12e
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target: HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) 202412
<br><br>
The browser links each mapped concept to that concept's page in the current production version of its terminology.

The first NCIt to HGNC mapping was manually curated by editors working at NCI in March of 2012. Automated term matching
was performed to create a preliminary mapping from the Gene branch of NCIt to the Approved Symbols in HGNC. The
preliminary map was reviewed by editors at NCI to map the HGNC to the wild-type (wt) allele concepts in NCIt. In
November 2016, the map was revised to better reflect the nature of both HGNC and NCIt concepts by mapping the HGNC codes
to the NCIt parent gene concepts. When new gene concepts are published in NCIt, they are mapped to the appropriate HGNC
concept, the mapping data file is updated, and the new mapping relationships are published
<br><br>
The Version shows the month and year that the mapping data were extracted. The Release Date shows the day that this
mapping was approved for publication.
