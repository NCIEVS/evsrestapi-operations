<p>Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical
  investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, applicable across various biological and technological
  domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a single domain. This ontology will support the consistent
  annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the
  design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type
  analysis performed on it. Currently OBI is being built under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).</p>
