	The Adult Mouse Anatomy (MA) ontology provides standardized
	nomenclature for anatomical entities in the postnatal mouse. Structured
	as a directed acyclic graph with 'is a' and 'part of' relationships,
	the MA organizes anatomical terms hierarchically from both spatial and
	anatomical systems perspectives. MA terms and identifiers are being
	used to annotate and integrate different types of data pertinent to
	mouse anatomy such as gene expression patterns, biological processes,
	and information about phenotypes and pathologies. The MA was developed
	and is being maintained and expanded as part of the Gene Expression
	Database (GXD) project (<a
