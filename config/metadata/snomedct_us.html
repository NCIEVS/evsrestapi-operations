	resources to support the implementation and use of SNOMED CT, including
	subsets, cross maps to existing classifications and coding schemes, and
	an extensive set of guidelines. SNOMED CT includes more than 311,000
	unique concepts. There are almost 800,000 descriptions in SNOMED CT,
	including synonyms that can be used to refer to a concept. In addition,
