This mapping is the product of a collaborative effort between the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a high quality,
automated solution for terminology interoperability for users of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
and International Statistical Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) 2019<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target: MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) 23.1<br><br>
The ICD-10 to MedDRA mapping and a document that describes how the mapping was developed was downloaded from the MedDRA
downloads page (https://www.meddra.org/user/login?page=%2Fsoftware-packages); MedDRA ID and password required). The
initial draft map (June 2023) was developed using the 2019 international core version of ICD-10 and MedDRA Version 23.1.
Individual 3-digit and 4-digit codes found in each chapter of ICD-10 have been mapped to MedDRA LLTs. Each term pair in
the map is assigned an attribute of “Equivalent”, “Loss of Information”, or “Unmapped”.<br><br>
The browser links each mapped concept to that concept's page in the current production version of its terminology (if
that concept is present in the current version).<br><br>
The Version shows the mapping release date as supplied by the MedDRA Maintenance and Support Services Organization
(MSSO). The Release Date shows the day that this mapping was published by EVS.<br><br>
The ICD-10 to MedDRA mapping file and the document describing the mapping conventions are available to NIH users;
however, licensing restrictions apply. Please contact ncithesaurus@mail.nih.gov. The files are avilable at this link:
