As part of the caBIG-funded Mouse-Human Anatomy Project (MHAP), the Adult Mouse Anatomy (MA) ontology and the set of
anatomy concepts contained in the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) were compared and harmonized. Matches between mouse and human
anatomy terms were identified and validated, resulting in a highly curated set of mappings between the two ontologies.
As both anatomical ontologies are being used to annotate different types of research data for mouse and human,
respectively, cross-mappings between the two ontologies will facilitate the integration of mouse and human data, and the
translation of basic research discoveries into clinical settings.
