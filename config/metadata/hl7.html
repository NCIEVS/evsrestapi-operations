<p>
HL7 Reference Information Model (HL7 RIM) is the cornerstone of the Health Level 7 (HL7) 
Version 3 development process. An object model created as part of the Version 3 methodology, 
the RIM is a large, structured representation of the HL7 clinical data domains and identifies 
the life cycle that a message or groups of related messages will carry. It is a shared model 
between all domains and, as such, is the model from which all domains create their messages. 
The RIM is an ANSI approved standard.
