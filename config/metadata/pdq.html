<p>Physician Data Query (PDQ) Terminology is part of NCI's
	comprehensive cancer information database, which contains expert
	summaries on a wide range of cancer topics, a listing of some 30,000
	cancer clinical trials from around the world, a directory of genetics
	services professionals, the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, and the NCI
	Drug Dictionary. PDQ Terminology provided much of the initial content
	for NCI Thesaurus, and the two terminologies have been extensively
	cross-linked and coordinated in areas of shared concern to support data
	sharing and interoperability.
