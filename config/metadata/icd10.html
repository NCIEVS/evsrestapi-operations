	many types of health and vital records including death certificates and
	health records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of
	diagnostic information for clinical, epidemiological and quality
	purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of
	national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States.
	ICD-10 was endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly in May
	1990 and has been in use in WHO Member States since 1994.</p>
