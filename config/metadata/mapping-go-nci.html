The first GO to NCIt mapping was manually curated by editors working at NCI in 2009. Automated term matching was
performed to create a preliminary map of the content in the Biological Process branch of NCIt and the GO
biological_process branch. The preliminary map was reviewed and validated by editors working at NCI to ensure that terms
with the same definitions were mapped. The map is updated when changes to the GO content invalidate current mapped
entries.

The Version shows the month and year that the mapping data were extracted. The Release Date shows the day that this
