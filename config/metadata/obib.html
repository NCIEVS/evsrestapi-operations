  biobanking administration. It is developed based on subset of Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) using Basic
  Formal Ontology (BFO) as top ontology and following OBO Foundry principles. The first version of the ontology is
  merged of two existing biobank related ontologies, OMIABIS and biobank ontology.</p>
