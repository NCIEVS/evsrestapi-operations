This is a manual EVS mapping of concepts with equivalent meaning in the source and target terminology versions shown
below:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: NCIt (NCI Thesaurus) 24.07e
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target: CHEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) v235
<br><br>
The browser links each mapped concept to that concept's page in the current production version of its terminology.
<br><br>
The first NCIt to CHEBI mapping was manually curated by editors working at NCI in November of 2011. Automated term
matching was performed to create a preliminary map of all of the content in NCIt with all of the content in CHEBI. The
preliminary map was reviewed and validated by editors working at NCI to ensure accuracy. Minor updates occur when new
chemical concepts published in NCIt are mapped to CHEBI concepts, and when changes in the CHEBI content invalidate
current mapped entries. Major updates, which involve the manual review of all of the unmapped content in NCIt against
all of the unmapped content in CHEBI, may occur approximately once every 2 or 3 years.

The Version shows the month and year that the mapping data were extracted. The Release Date shows the day that this
mapping was approved for publication.
