The PDQ to NCIt mapping is extracted from the NCI Metathesaurus (NCIm), and it reflects the mappings created by EVS NCIm
editors and available in the NCIm MRMAP.RRF file. This mapping is updated when a new version of PDQ is published in
NCIm. The current mapping is based on the source and target terminology versions shown below:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: PDQ (Physician Data Query) 2016_07
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target: NCIt (NCI Thesaurus) 16.10e
<br><br>
The browser links each mapped concept to that concept's page in the current production version of its terminology.
<br><br>
The Version shows the year followed by the month and reflects the version of NCIm from which the MRMAP.RRF was
extracted. The Release Date shows the day that this mapping was approved for publication.
